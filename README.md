# common-equations
A repo to hold common equations written in MathJax(LaTeX). Please feel free to contribute and add any commonly used math formulas to the notebook.  I suggest viewing the notebook on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ctufts/common-equations/blob/master/common_equations.ipynb) as github doesn't render some of the equations correctly.
